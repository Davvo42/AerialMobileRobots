A report on UAVs with a Gripen simulation. Done for the final project of the Mobile Robotics course at the University of Granada.

The report is very self-explicative. We analyze in details
- the current UAVs types
- their kinematic and dynamic models
- UAVs as autonomous systems
- the control problem
- application examples

Also we perform a simulation on the Matlab software of a Gripen for trajectory following, by means of a LQG controller.
